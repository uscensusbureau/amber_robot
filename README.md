# The UConn AMBER (Adaptive Morphing and Balanced Exploratory Rover) Project

A group of undergraduates at the University of Connecticut were selected as finalists in the annual NASA Big Idea Challenge ([see our submission](https://bigidea.nianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2022-BIG-Idea-Challenge-Finalist-Team-Synopses.pdf) or the [video](https://youtu.be/4zF1PQumCn8))

# Project setup
## Prerequisites:
**Make sure you are either using a Linux-based operating system or have setup WSL ([Windows Subsystem for Linux]( https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/))**
### Docker
Docker is a containerization platform so that code can be run identically across different system setups. 
[Install `docker` here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
Additionally [install `docker-compose` here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Rust
In the future this won't be necessary since we may setup Rust directly in the container, but for now, [install rust locally](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your linux distro. 

## Setup
***WARNING* Make sure you are running this in linux!!!**

**(1) Run `install_deps.sh`**

This automatically installs all other linux dependencies needed to make the code work. It also installs any cargo packages required.
```
bash install_deps.sh
```

**(2) Build and run the docker container**
```
docker-compose up
```
If it's working, this should start outputing messages sent across ROS services. Example:
```
listener_1    | data: "hello"
listener_1    | ---
listener_1    | data: "hello"
listener_1    | ---
listener_1    | data: "hello"
```

**(3 Non-virtualized linux users)** See if `urdf-viz` functions properly

A screen should pop up with something that looks like a robot. This is a visualizer for the [Unified Robot Description Format](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf)
```
urdf-viz ./config/test.urdf
```
